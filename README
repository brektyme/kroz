This code is bad and I should feel bad.

(Seriously, it's terrible. I wrote in a very short amount of time
with very little knowledge of python.)

Now with Josh helping, we're attempting to make this into a semi-usable framework for small python
text-based adventures.

Currently the plan is to use a directed graph with edges that represent the cardinal directions used
in the game, it's also possible that other directions (up,down,right,left) could be added.
